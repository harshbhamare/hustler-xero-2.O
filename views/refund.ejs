            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Thank you for choosing Hustler.XERO for your learning journey. We are committed to providing a
                transparent and fair refund process. This policy applies to all programs and services purchased through
                our platform. By making a payment, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Refund Eligibility</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">
                A refund may be issued only under specific conditions. Once a program has officially commenced (i.e.,
                the first lecture has been delivered or course materials have been made accessible), we are unable to
                process any refunds.
            </p>

                <li><strong class="text-gray-800">Program Cancellation by Hustler.XERO:</strong> In the rare event that
                    we cancel a program, all enrolled participants will receive a full 100% refund of the amount paid.
                </li>
                <li><strong class="text-gray-800">Incorrect Enrollment:</strong> If you enrolled in the wrong course and
                    notify us within 24 hours of payment, we will assist you in transferring to the correct program. If
                    a transfer is not possible, a full refund may be considered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Non-Refundable Items</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">The following items are not eligible for a refund:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">

                <li>Refunds for payments made after the specified cancellation window.</li>
                <li>Programs or services marked as "non-refundable" at the time of purchase.</li>
